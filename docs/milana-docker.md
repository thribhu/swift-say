# Docker Nginx Express React application

To get the full advantage of yarn workspaces, we use the below dicipline 
- ** NGINX **
- ** EXPRESS ** 
- ** REACT **

To implement a robust api gateway we will use nginx and ambitious to be building a single source file and acheive the request routing, load balancing, security, caching, logging and monitoring, respons transformation. 

1. **Request Routing**: Nginx can route incoming requests to different backend services based on the request URL or other criteria. This allows you to have multiple APIs or microservices behind Nginx, and Nginx can direct traffic to the appropriate service.

2. **Load Balancing**: Nginx can distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load. This is useful for scaling your APIs horizontally to handle increased traffic.

3. **Security**: Nginx can be configured to provide security features such as rate limiting, access control, authentication, and SSL termination, helping protect your APIs from various threats.

4. **Caching**: Nginx can cache responses from your API, reducing the load on your backend servers and improving response times for frequently requested data.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Nginx provides extensive logging capabilities, which can be helpful for monitoring and debugging API traffic.

6. **Response Transformation**: You can configure Nginx to modify or transform responses from your backend services before they are sent to clients. This is useful for tasks like response compression or adding response headers.

Here's a basic example of how you can configure Nginx as an API gateway:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.milana.com;

    location /request-event {
        proxy_pass http://api.milana.com/resouces/v1;
    }

    location /inside-sales {
        proxy_pass http://api.milana.com/supervisor/v1;
    }

    # Other configuration options such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching can be added here.
}
```

In this example:

- Nginx listens on port 80 for requests to `api.milana.com`.
- Requests to `/request-event` are routed to `resources/v1`.
- Requests to `/inside-sales` are routed to `supervisor/v1`.
